"Little Lemon Restaurant Reservation System"
This project is a web-based reservation system for Little Lemon restaurant. It features a user-friendly booking form that allows customers to make reservations by providing their name, selecting a date, and choosing an available time slot. Key features include:

Interactive booking form with date selector and time slot dropdown
Real-time availability updates to prevent double bookings
Current date auto-selection when opening the booking form
Display of existing reservations for the selected date
API endpoint to retrieve bookings for specific dates
JSON data representation of all reservations
Integration with a database to store and manage bookings
Responsive design with a clean, modern interface

The system is built using a web framework (likely Django based on the criteria) with a configured database and proper app installation. It employs front-end technologies like the Fetch API to interact with the backend seamlessly. The project adheres to best practices by performing necessary migrations, preventing duplicate bookings, and providing clear feedback when no bookings are available for a given date.
This reservation system streamlines the booking process for Little Lemon restaurant, improving customer experience and helping staff manage reservations efficiently.
